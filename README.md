# Where Am I?
Where Am I is a Drupal 7 module to help developers know with a glance the environment being worked in.

To use:

To add 'Where Am I' you can go to Structure -> Block Layout (admin/structure/block) and click on 'Place Block' button associated
with each available region.

Clicking on 'Place Block' button for any given region a "Place Block" dialogue pop-up will appear, with a listing of all
available blocks. To quickly find the block, simply use 'Filter by block name' option or use mouse-scroll to locate
'Where Am I'. This way you can add any number of instances of the custom block anywhere on your site.
